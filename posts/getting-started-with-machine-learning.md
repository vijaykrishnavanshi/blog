Machine Learning is one of the most intriguing field of computer science. You do not need a degree to learn and practice machine learning. In fact, you donâ€™t need a degree if you want to explore research in machine learning. It's fun to learn.

MOOCs are the best ways to kick start in some field with a good book of that to read when free.

Some great examples of Machine Learning MOOCs include :

    - MIT 15.075 Statistical Thinking and Data Analysis
    - Stanford CS229 Machine Learning
    - Stanford Statistics 315a Modern Applied Statistics: Elements of 
      Statistical Learning
    - Caltech Learning from Data University of Washington Coursera
      Specialization

Examples of good textbooks are:

    - Machine Learning: The Art and Science of Algorithms that Make
      Sense of Data
    - Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective
    - The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference,
      and Prediction
    - Introduction to Statistical Learning in R
 
Once you get started with the courses and books you should start looking out for data to practice on. "Learn and Implement" is the best way to ensure whether you know your stuff or not.
Data can be collected from various sources like Kaggle and TunedIt.

The skills that you learn are applicable in industry, but real-world problems do require more than that. This area of learning is not for everyone, but does offer a lot for those whom it does suit.

Competitions are often held in conjunction with academic conferences. Recent companies have opened up their data to competitions to get more out of the best brains of this world.
