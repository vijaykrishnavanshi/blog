What it means is that we are the beings that are conscious of their existence because of our sensory organs and the brain interpreting in order that makes sense. Whatever we receive as an input with the help of our sensory organs is first converted into signals and is sent to the brain for processing and if everything goes fine we know the world as we know it. Every information that is relayed through the brain is acted upon by its processes and is manipulated.

Let's say for a moment that our brain starts adding new information into the information that it receives, it turns into the situation which is observed in patients that suffer from illusions. In another word whatever our brain interprets that becomes our reality and that is what we see around us. So there goes the saying perception of reality changes the reality of perception.
