I have had this itch to create things and after having so many ideas I have finally decided to pursue a few of ideas.

One thing I have learnt by being a part of multiple product building teams is that, lose focus from your audience for a second and you end up baking your biases in the end product. Every feature design should be user centric for it to be delight to use. I would like to put to use my learnings and hypothesis by building a product. 

We'll see where it goes.
